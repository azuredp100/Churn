# Churn
Customer churn prediction using Logistic Regression with data preprocessing, feature scaling, and evaluation via confusion matrix and classification metrics.
# Customer Churn Prediction – Logistic Regression

## Overview

This project predicts customer churn using a Logistic Regression model. The objective is to identify customers likely to leave a service based on historical data.

## Approach

* Removed duplicate and non-informative columns
* Selected numeric features and applied feature scaling
* Trained a Logistic Regression model
* Evaluated performance using a confusion matrix and classification metrics

## Evaluation

Model performance was assessed using:

* Confusion Matrix
* Accuracy
* Precision, Recall, and F1-score

## Tools

Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Outcome

The model provides a reliable baseline for churn prediction and can be extended with additional feature engineering or advanced models.
